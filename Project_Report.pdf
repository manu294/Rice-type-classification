🧠Project Objective
To build a deep learning-based model that can detect and classify the type of rice grain from
an image using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
🚀 Tools & Technologies Used
• Python
• TensorFlow / Keras
• NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
• LabelEncoder
• Scikit-learn
• Flask (for Web Deployment)
• HTML, CSS (for Frontend Design)
📂Dataset Information
The dataset contains 5 different types of rice grains:
1. Arborio
2. Basmati
3. Ipsala
4. Jasmine
5. Karacadag
Each class contains labeled images for training and testing the model.
🔨Project Workflow
1. Data Collection – Images were collected and organized.
2. Preprocessing – Resizing, normalization, and label encoding were done.
3. Model Building – A CNN architecture was created using Keras.
4. Training – The model was trained with high accuracy on rice grain images.
5. Testing – Model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy and
confusion matrix.
6. Deployment – Flask was used to create a web application for rice type prediction.
